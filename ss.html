</h3>
<h4>Jim Robinson brought his first motorcycle home to the family farm in the 1940’s. Farm life began taking a back seat to the excitement of fixing and racing motorcycles.<br> The small tractor and car repair shop Jim built on the farm was an ideal place to stock a few parts for bike repairs for others.<br> In the early 50’s Firth Motorcycles and McBride Cycles in Toronto suggested Jim take a bike or two and sell from the farm.<br> Matchless, Ducati, and AJS were some of the first. The farm focus quickly turned to bikes.
<br>
In the mid 50’s to early 60’s after Jim and Bev married, the farm life began taking a back seat as the motorcycles developed into a full time business.<br> Triumph, BSA and Norton were coming to the farm. The 60’s saw the Japanese bikes arrive; Hondas followed by Yamaha, Kawasaki and Suzuki.<br> Harley and BMW also found a home on the Robinson farm in the 60’s. The small garage needed a major expansion. A large showroom was built.<br> A warehouse and airplane hangar behind the bike shop awaited truckloads of bikes Jim was hauling weekly from Toronto. <br>The chicken coop and milking barn were a thing of Jim and Bev’s past.
